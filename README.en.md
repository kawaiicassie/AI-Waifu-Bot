## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup: Creating a Bot on Discord

Before you can run the code, you need to create a "bot application" on Discord to get a `TOKEN`.

1.  **Create an Application**:
    -   Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in.
    -   Click the **"New Application"** button in the top right corner and give your bot a name.

2.  **Create a Bot and Get the Token**:
    -   In the left menu, select the **"Bot"** tab.
    -   Click **"Add Bot"** -> **"Yes, do it!"**.
    -   Below the bot's name, click **"Reset Token"** and copy this token. (**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT share this token with anyone!**)
    -   Scroll down and enable all 3 items under **Privileged Gateway Intents**:
        -   `PRESENCE INTENT`
        -   `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`
        -   `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT` (Crucial for the bot to read messages)

3.  **Invite the Bot to Your Server**:
    -   Go to the **"OAuth2"** tab -> **"URL Generator"**.
    -   Under **SCOPES**, check `bot` and `applications.commands`.
    -   A **BOT PERMISSIONS** box will appear below. Check the necessary permissions for the bot, for example:
        -   `Send Messages`
        -   `Read Message History`
        -   `Attach Files`
        -   `Use Slash Commands`
    -   Copy the generated URL from the **GENERATED URL** box below, paste it into your browser, and select the server you want to invite the bot to.

Now you have your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and the bot is in your server, ready to be launched!

You can deploy Waifu Bot in two ways:

### 1. Run Directly on Windows (Simple, for development purposes)

This method is suitable if you want to run the bot on your personal computer for testing or development.

1.  **Install Python**:
    -   Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.10 or higher) installed.
    -   During installation, remember to check the `Add Python to PATH` box.

2.  **Clone the Repo and Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Clone the code to your machine
    git clone https://github.com/kawaiicassie/AI-Waifu-Bot.git
    cd AI-Waifu-Bot

    # Install necessary libraries
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file**:
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
    -   Add the following content to the file and replace it with your tokens:
        ```
        DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
        POLLINATIONS_API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
        ```

4.  **Run the Bot**:
    -   Open a Terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run the command:
        ```bash
        python bot.py
        ```
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: The bot will only work while this terminal window is running and your computer is on.

### 2. Using Docker (Flexible, for deployment purposes)

If you want to host the bot on a VPS or a more stable environment, Docker is an excellent choice.

1.  **Clone the Repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kawaiicassie/AI-Waifu-Bot.git
    cd AI-Waifu-Bot
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file**:
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
    -   Add the following content to the file and replace it with your tokens:
        ```
        DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
        POLLINATIONS_API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
        ```

3.  **Build and Run the Docker Container**:
    -   Open a terminal and run the following commands:
        ```bash
        # Build the Docker image
        docker build -t image-name:latest .

        # Run the container in detached mode
        docker run -d --name container-name image-name:latest
        ```
    -   Your bot is now running inside the container!
